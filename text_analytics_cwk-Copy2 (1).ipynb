    "As HDA did not work but located over 140 topics, I turned to LDA. as there are 4 emotions in the dataset i started with 4 topics. This did not yield very coherent topics, as they contained a lot of crossover and didnt have clear themes. As I increased the number of topics, I saw more granular groups emerging. I used the concept of Coherence score to test these topics and made a for loop function which tested the coherence for a range of topic numbers. It was found that 35-40 topics achieved the best results, and I opted for the lower value to balance fine granularity. I also tested the dud result from HDA and found that 140 topics did not get a better coherence. "
